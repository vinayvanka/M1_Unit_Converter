 # Requirements

 ## Introduction
 Unit connverter is an utility that allows user to convert unit values according to the user needs and requirement. This project is titled as **Unit Converter Utility** 
 and devloped using c language.
 when a user want to convert a value in one unit to another, user need to entre their required conversion type by entering their option shown in the menu, after that user need to enter value  to be converted, after this they will get their desired output. 

 ### Advantages
 -   Easy and faster access
 -   can be used anywhere
 -   Future Proof

 ### Disadvantages
 -   GUI is needed
 -   limited converstions

 ## Cost and Features
 -   EasierAccess
 -   Low Cost
